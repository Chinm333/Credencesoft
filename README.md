Web Scrapping
*Using BeautifulSoup4 and request module
By using the "request" module of python, I requested the website for the data's.
On requesting they provided me the data which is belong to them.
by inspecting, I got the skeleton of the page "chewy".
As I got the skeleton , I scrapt using '<a>',class,h1,title etc and converted into text.
And print the output as our requirement.
